        <p>Dear my future wife Oumayma</p>
 <p>As the clock strikes midnight and the world moves into a new year, my heart beats for you, my love, louder than ever before. Tonight, I want to tell you the depth of my feelings.. feelings I carry with me every moment of every day, yet words can never seem to capture the fullness of my love. But I’ll try. I will pour out everything I feel for you, for you deserve nothing less than every part of my heart, my soul, and my every thought. From the moment I met you, I knew something magical had happened. I didn’t understand it fully then, but now, I see that you are the light that illuminated the path of my life, the answer to questions I didn’t know I had, the muse to the love song that is my existence. With you, oumayma, I discovered a kind of love I didn’t know was possible, a love so pure, so consuming, that it leaves me breathless. It’s as though my soul recognized you before I even met you... like fate itself drew us together in a moment that felt like eternity. Every time I see u, it’s as if time itself slows down, and all that matters in this world is you. Your beauty, oumaymaa, takes my breath away.. not just in the way you look, but in the way you move, the way you speak, the way you simply exist. Your laughter is like music to my ears, and when you smile, it’s as though the entire universe is smiling with you. I’ve never known a love so beautiful, so intense. Every inch of you, every word you speak, every glance you give, fills my heart with an indescribable joy that I can’t explain. My world has become infinitely better because you’re in it, and I can’t imagine a single day without you by my side.. When I think of you, oumayma, my heart races in my chest, my mind spins with thoughts of you... of your kindness, your grace, your strength, and your heart. You are the woman I’ve been searching for, the one my soul has longed for since time began. In your eyes, I see a future so beautiful that it takes my breath away. I see us, together, forever.... hand in hand, heart in heart, never apart. I want to stand by you, support you, protect you, and love you with a passion that will burn for all eternity. I dream of our future, and I see us, two souls intertwined, building a life filled with joy, laughter, and love. I see us growing old together, facing every challenge as one, and sharing in the happiness of life’s most beautiful moments. I imagine the sound of our children’s laughter echoing through the halls of our home, a home filled with warmth, love, and everything we’ve ever dreamed of. I want to be the man who stands beside you through every moment of our lives, whether the days are bright and full of joy or dark and filled with challenges. I will be there for you, oumayma, in ways that words can never describe, with a love so deep that it will move mountains for you. But it’s not just the future that excites me, oumayma. It’s the here and now.. the way you make me feel every single day. When I look into your eyes, it feels like I’m seeing the entire universe in one glance. When you laugh, it’s as if the world pauses for that one moment, and everything is perfect. When you speak, your voice is a melody that fills me with peace. You are my home, oumayma. You are everything I’ve ever wanted, everything I’ve ever needed. With you, I feel whole. With you, I feel alive. I want  u to be my wife, oumayma. I want you to be the mother of our children. I want to build a life with you, filled with love and happiness, with every moment cherished like a precious gem. I want to grow old with you, my love, and I want you to be the one I turn to in every moment of my life.. whether it’s the most joyous or the most difficult. You are my everything, oumayma. You are the woman I want to stand beside, to love, to cherish, to build a future with. There is no one else I could imagine by my side, no one else who could ever compare to the love I feel for you. With you, I feel as though anything is possible. I feel like we can conquer the world together, that no obstacle is too great, no dream too far out of reach. You make me believe in a love that transcends time, a love that is eternal. And every time I think of you, my heart beats faster, and my soul longs for you. You are my greatest treasure, oumayma, and I promise to love you with all that I am, for all eternity. There is nothing I wouldn’t do for you, nothing I wouldn’t sacrifice, because you are worth everything to me. As this year ends and we step into a new one, know that I am more in love with you than ever before. You have given me a love so deep, so beautiful, that I am forever changed. You have given me a reason to live, to love, to be the best version of myself, and for that, I am eternally grateful. I want to be the one who makes your dreams come true. I want to be the one who builds a life of love and happiness with you, who creates a future with you by my side, and who stands with you through everything that comes our way. I want you, oumayma, for now and forever. u are my heart, my soul, my everything. I love you more than words can ever express, and I will continue to love you with every beat of my heart... As the days pass and the years unfold, I find myself unable to stop thinking about you. You have become the rhythm of my heart, the very breath that fills my lungs, and the light that guides me through the darkest times. My love for you is boundless, and I feel compelled to put into words what has long been swirling in my soul... though I know that no amount of words could ever truly express the depth of my feelings for you. I will try, my love, for you are worth every attempt.

From the moment our eyes first met, I knew something extraordinary had begun. At that moment, I didn’t fully understand it, but with each passing day, it becomes clearer: you, oumayma, are the woman my heart had been waiting for. It is as if the universe had conspired to bring us together, to connect our souls in a way that transcends time, space, and every circumstance. Meeting you feels like the fulfillment of a beautiful destiny, and since that first encounter, I’ve felt a profound shift within me. You’ve awakened a love in me so deep, so powerful, that it often leaves me breathless. I want you to know that you are the only one who has ever made my heart beat this fast. You are the only one who has ignited a fire within me so intense that I cannot imagine living without it. Every thought I have, every dream I dream, they all lead back to you. You are the muse of my life, the spark that makes everything worthwhile, the source of my joy, my hope, my passion. My love for you is infinite, and as time passes, it only grows stronger, more unwavering, more profound. With every passing moment spent with you, I feel like I am living a beautiful dream... one where you are my everything. I imagine a future with you, and it fills me with an indescribable peace and excitement. I see us growing old together, hand in hand, facing every challenge and every joy side by side. I see us building a life together, a life filled with the laughter of our children, the warmth of our home, and the unshakable love we share. I imagine the little moments... our morning coffee together, the quiet nights spent talking, the simple yet profound moments when our hands touch, and our hearts connect in ways words could never describe. I long for a future where I can call you my wife, where I can promise to love you for the rest of my life. I dream of the day when I can look into your eyes and say, “You are mine, and I am yours,” and know that we are bound together by a love that is unbreakable. You are the woman I want to stand beside through every challenge and every triumph. You are the one I want to support, protect, and care for....because you deserve nothing less than all the love, respect, and devotion I have to give. When I think of the future we can have together, my heart swells with happiness. I see us creating a beautiful family a home filled with love, laughter, and the sound of children’s voices. I want to raise our children with you, oumayma, to teach them the values that will guide them in life, to help them grow into kind, compassionate, and strong individuals. And in every step of this journey, I want to be by your side, supporting you, loving you, and cherishing you. Together, we will create a world where love, respect, and faith guide us through every season of life. u are my home, oumayma. You are where my heart belongs. There is no one else in this world who could ever take your place. Your beauty, both inside and out, captivates me in ways I cannot even begin to describe. The way your eyes light up when you laugh, the way your voice brings me peace, the way you care for others with such grace and kindness.. it all takes my breath away. You are not just beautiful on the outside; your soul, your heart, your spirit—everything about you is extraordinary. You are the most precious treasure I’ve ever known, and I am endlessly grateful to have found you. In every moment with you, I feel as though time stops, and the world fades away. It’s just you and me, two souls connected in a way that defies logic. Every moment spent with you is a gift, and I treasure each one as if it were the most precious thing in the world. Your presence fills me with a peace I never knew existed. You make my life brighter, fuller, and more meaningful in ways I could never have imagined before you came into my life. I am a better person because of you, oumayma. You inspire me to be the best version of myself every single day. But more than that, you make me believe in a love that is eternal, a love that transcends all things. You make me believe that anything is possible, that together, we can conquer the world. With you by my side, I feel invincible, like nothing can stand in our way. I want to build a future with you, one filled with dreams realized, goals achieved, and love that only grows deeper with time. I want to grow old with you, my love, and look back on our lives with pride and joy, knowing that we’ve built something beautiful together... a love so deep, so powerful, that it will stand the test of time. u are my one and only, oumayma. The woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. There is no one else who could ever compare to you, no one else who could ever take your place. I want to give you my heart, my soul, my everything, because you are my everything. I want to build a life with you, one that is full of love, laughter, and all the beauty this world has to offer.. I want to be the man who makes your dreams come true. I want to be the one who stands by you in every moment of your life, who supports you through every challenge, who loves you with all that I am. I want to be the man who makes you feel cherished, adored, and valued every single day. I want to be the one who fills your life with joy, laughter, and love, because that is what you deserve, and more. As this year ends, I want you to know that my love for you only grows stronger with time. There is no one else in this world who could ever replace you. You are my heart, my soul, my everything. You are the one I want to build a future with, the one I want to raise a family with, and the one I want to spend the rest of my life loving...... I close my eyes now and imagine myself lying next to you, in a new, bright morning, feeling the warmth of your body close to mine as you sleep beside me in peace, your beautiful face bathed in the morning light. In that moment, I feel as though the whole world has faded away, and nothing matters except seeing you by my side. I savor the moment of tranquility and comfort, knowing that you are there, in my life. I gradually wake up, feeling the fingers of sunlight slipping through the window to gently touch your face. I open my eyes softly and turn to see your beautiful face. Your eyes are closed in peaceful sleep, as if you're drifting through your dreams, while I am here, watching you with all my love and longing. I can’t explain how just looking at you makes me feel that everything in the world has become perfect. It feels as though I am living in the most beautiful love story, where you are the heroine and the source of my happiness and the calmness of my heart. In that moment, all I want to do is continue watching your beautiful eyes, which encompass all the meanings of love, beauty, and peace. I feel as though I want to read everything in your eyes, discover every detail of you, every hidden emotion, and every dream that you hold. You are my entire world, and every time those pure glances from you envelop me, I realize that I have reached the highest level of happiness that a person can experience. u are the tranquility I seek every morning, and in this world, full of noise and chaos, I find peace in you. Our breaths align together, and in that quiet moment, it feels as if time has stopped, as if we are in a place untouched by the world, where only you and I exist. As I watch you, you smile involuntarily, and I feel my heart racing, because nothing is more beautiful than being here with you, sharing this morning, with you beside me. I wish that this moment could last forever, and that time would never pass, because simply, I don’t want anything else except to remain here, with you, savoring every minute, living in your love, and you sharing that with me in your soft smile... When you finally wake up, and our new day begins, I know that together we will face every challenge and fulfill every dream. But for now, in this morning, all I want is to enjoy having you by my side, and you filling my life with your love and smile. I need nothing else except for you to be here, with every passing moment, and every day we embrace together. u are everything I want in this life, oumayma, and you are my eternal love. I will continue to cherish every moment with you, every morning I wake up next to you, and every night we end together, with you in my arms. I love u more than ever, and every day I live with you is a gift from allah....There is something I want to promise you with every fiber of my being.. something so pure, so deep, that it comes from the core of my heart. I want you to know that I will make everything between us halal, pure, and sacred. Every step we take, every moment we share, will be grounded in respect, love, and devotion, following the path of what is right and blessed by Allah. I imagine the day, the most beautiful day of my life, when I will stand before your father, with all the respect in the world, asking for your hand. My heart beats faster just thinking about it, knowing that I will finally be able to say, with full sincerity and certainty, that I want you to be mine in the most honorable way possible. I will stand there, as a man who is ready to take full responsibility for you, for your happiness, for your dreams, for your future. I will hold your father’s gaze, and with all the sincerity and honesty in my eyes, I will tell him that I promise to cherish you, to protect you, and to give you a love that will never waver. When I take your hand that day, it will not just be a simple gesture. It will be the beginning of a lifetime, a promise that I will guard your heart like the most precious treasure. Your hand, with its soft touch, will be the symbol of my deepest commitment to you, as we walk into the future together. I will always hold it with the utmost care, guiding you through life’s trials, shielding you from harm, and never letting go.

In the years ahead, you will see that my love for you is not just a fleeting emotion, but a lifelong dedication. I will wake up every morning with a sense of purpose: to be the man who stands by your side, the one who will protect your heart from any harm, the one who will always listen when you need someone to talk to, and the one who will stand tall through any storm that life may bring. I will be the shield when the world feels too heavy, and the safe harbor where you can always find peace and comfort. I will be there, through every challenge, every moment of doubt, and every obstacle. And when you need a reminder of your worth, I will be the one to lift you up, to remind you of your strength, beauty, and the light that you bring into my life. I will protect you not only in the physical sense, but also in the emotional and spiritual realms. I will honor your soul, I will respect your dreams, and I will love you for the entirety of who you are. I imagine a future where we build our home together, a place of peace, warmth, and love. I want it to be a home filled with laughter, with patience, and with the beauty of two souls entwined in love and faith. I will work tirelessly to create a life for us, where every day is filled with love and devotion to one another. Together, we will raise our children in a home where faith, love, and respect are the foundation. They will see in us what it means to love with pure hearts, to give selflessly, and to protect what is most important. I want to be the man who stands by you, who listens to your thoughts, who shares your dreams, and who helps you make them come true. I want to be the one you can always turn to, the one who will never falter in his commitment to you. I will always be your support, your strength, and your refuge.

oumayma , you are the one I want to spend every moment with, and I promise you, with all my heart, that I will be the man who deserves you. I will protect your dignity, your heart, and your dreams, and I will cherish you like the precious gift that you are. You will always be my priority, my love, and my purpose. So, when that day comes, and I take your hand in mine, I will know that it is the beginning of everything I have ever wanted. A lifetime of love, of commitment, of being the man you need and deserve. I will cherish and honor you every single day, and I will always strive to be the man who will stand by you, love you, and protect you for the rest of our lives. With all my heart and all my love
